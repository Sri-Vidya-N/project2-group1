## AWS S3 Integration for Profile Picture Upload

### Setting Up S3 Bucket

1. **Create an S3 Bucket**:
   - Log in to your **AWS Management Console**.
   - Navigate to **S3** and create a bucket. Set the appropriate region, and ensure that the bucket is public if you want the profile pictures to be accessible publicly.

2. **Update the Bucket Policy**:
   Allow public access to the bucket by configuring the correct **bucket policy**. Hereâ€™s an example policy:
   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": "*",
         "Action": "s3:GetObject",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<Your-Bucket-Name>/*"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

## Usage
